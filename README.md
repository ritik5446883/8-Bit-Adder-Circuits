# 8-Bit-Adder-Circuits
Comparative Analysis of 8-Bit Adder Circuits Using Static CMOS Implementation
# Overview
This project focuses on the comparative analysis of four different 8-bit adder circuits implemented using static CMOS logic. The objective is to evaluate and compare their performance based on three critical parameters: delay, power, and area. The adders under analysis are:

1. Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) 
2. Look-Ahead Carry Adder (LCA)
3. Carry Skip Adder (CSA)
4. Carry Select Adder (CSLA)
